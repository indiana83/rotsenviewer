=============================
OVERVIEW  
.............................
This module provides sample code used to demonstrate the signal processing of 
rotation sensor (based on potential meter) in gaming wheel. The voltage output 
of rotation sensor will be digitized through AD-conversion and transmitted
to the application. Afterwards the sensor data will be displayed on the screen.
When sample is executed you should be able to see the following:
- real-time digital read out of rotation sensor data
- plot of sensor output

FILES   
.............................
- DrawDevice.cpp: implementation of DrawDevice helper class used to manage Direct3D device
- DrawDevice.h: declaration of DrawDevice helper class
